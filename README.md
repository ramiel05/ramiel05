Better engineering through experimentation, getting hands dirty, and building for future me in mind (by pretending other devs are already working on these projects).

Some things in here will be overengineered for the sake of my learning and understanding, others will be kept as simple as possible.

Some nostalgia for decentralized web golden age.
